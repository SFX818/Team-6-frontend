            <h3>About this Project</h3>
            <p>COV-ID was built during the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 and 2021. We noticed that while information about the virus was seemingly everywhere, it generally took multiple searches to find all the relevant information.</p>
            
            <p>COV-ID strives to allow users to see coronavirus statistics for locations that are relevant to them. We are a global society, and getting updates for multiple places is far from an uncommon need. Someone living in New York might have family in California, as well as friends overseas. COV-ID allows them to track statistics for all of these locations in real time, and with only a few clicks</p>

            <p>We hope there comes a day when this app won't be needed anymore, but until then, please wear your mask, socially distance, and be safe.</p>
