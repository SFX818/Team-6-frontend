## Issues
- isAdmin (authJwt) does not play nice with front end
    - currently removed so we can work on those pages, but will need to be fixed eventually

## To-Do
- [x] populate user roles with more than ids
- [x] useParams for :id routes
- [x] add LogOut function to Layout
- [] refactor updateUser to just update roles / makeAdmin checkbox (?)
    - probably will require backend work too
